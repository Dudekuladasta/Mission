This Dockerfile is designed to create a Docker image for a Java application using OpenJDK 11. 
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each line does:

FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk11: 
	Specifies the base image to use, which is adoptopenjdk/openjdk11. This image includes OpenJDK 11, 
	which is necessary for running Java applications.

EXPOSE 8080: 
	Informs Docker that the container listens on port 8080 at runtime. This is the port that your 
	application will use to accept incoming requests.

ENV APP_HOME /usr/src/app: 
	Sets an environment variable APP_HOME with the value /usr/src/app. 
	This is used to define the application's home directory within the container.

COPY target/*.jar $APP_HOME/app.jar: 
	Copies the JAR file from the target directory on the host machine to the APP_HOME directory inside the container, 
	renaming it to app.jar. The target directory is typically where the JAR file is placed 
	after building the Java application (e.g., using Maven or Gradle).

WORKDIR $APP_HOME: 
	Sets the working directory inside the container to APP_HOME. 
	Any subsequent commands will be run from this directory.

CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]: 
	Defines the command to run when the container starts. 
	This command will execute java -jar app.jar, starting the Java application.

*********Full Dockerfile Explained************

dockerfile
	Copy code
		# Use the OpenJDK 11 base image from AdoptOpenJDK
			FROM adoptopenjdk/openjdk11

		# Expose port 8080 to the host
			EXPOSE 8080

		# Set the environment variable for the application home directory
			ENV APP_HOME /usr/src/app

		# Copy the JAR file from the host machine to the app directory in the container
			COPY target/*.jar $APP_HOME/app.jar

		# Set the working directory
			WORKDIR $APP_HOME

		# Command to run the application
			CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
	
		Additional Considerations
		
		Building the Docker Image: To build the Docker image using this Dockerfile, 
		navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:

		sh
		Copy code
		docker build -t my-java-app .
		Replace my-java-app with the desired name for your Docker image.

		Running the Docker Container: To run a container from the image, use:

		sh
		Copy code
		docker run -p 8080:8080 my-java-app
		This will map port 8080 on your host to port 8080 in the container, 
		allowing you to access your application via http://localhost:8080.

		Dependency Management: Ensure that all dependencies are included in the JAR file during the build process, 
		usually through a build tool like Maven or Gradle.

		Environment Variables: If your application requires additional environment variables, 
		you can add them using the ENV instruction
